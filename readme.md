Project Description: The following project aims to predict mileage per gallon(mps) using various technical specifications (features) as input to the regression algorithms. 

Context The data is technical spec of cars. The dataset is downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository

Content Title: Auto-Mpg Data

Sources: (a) Origin: This dataset was taken from the StatLib library which is maintained at Carnegie Mellon University. The dataset was used in the 1983 American Statistical Association Exposition. (c) Date: July 7, 1993

Past Usage:

See 2b (above) Quinlan,R. (1993). Combining Instance-Based and Model-Based Learning. In Proceedings on the Tenth International Conference of Machine Learning, 236-243, University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Morgan Kaufmann. Relevant Information:

This dataset is a slightly modified version of the dataset provided in the StatLib library. In line with the use by Ross Quinlan (1993) in predicting the attribute "mpg", 8 of the original instances were removed because they had unknown values for the "mpg" attribute. The original dataset is available in the file "auto-mpg.data-original".

"The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon, to be predicted in terms of 3 multivalued discrete and 5 continuous attributes." (Quinlan, 1993)

Number of Instances: 398

Number of Attributes: 9 including the class attribute

Attribute Information:

mpg: continuous cylinders: multi-valued discrete displacement: continuous horsepower: continuous weight: continuous acceleration: continuous model year: multi-valued discrete origin: multi-valued discrete car name: string (unique for each instance) Missing Attribute Values: horsepower has 6 missing values
